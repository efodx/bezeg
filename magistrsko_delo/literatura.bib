    abstract = {The linear map $\mathbf{M}$ that takes the Bernstein coefficients of a polynomial $P(t)$ on a given interval $\lbrack a, b\rbrack$ into those on any subinterval $\lbrack\bar a, \bar b\rbrack$ is specified by a stochastic matrix which depends only on the degree $n$ of $P(t)$ and the size and location of $\lbrack\bar a, \bar b\rbrack$ relative to $\lbrack a, b\rbrack$. We show that in the $\|\cdot\|_\infty$-norm, the condition number of $\mathbf{M}$ has the simple form $\kappa_\infty(\mathbf{M}) = \lbrack 2 f \max(u_{\bar m}, \nu_{\bar m})\rbrack^n$, where $u_{\bar m} = (\bar m - a)/(b - a)$ and $\nu_{\bar m}= (b - \bar m)/(b - a)$ are the barycentric coordinates of the subinterval midpoint $\bar m = \frac{1}{2} (\bar a + \bar b)$, and $f$ denotes the "zoom" factor $(b - a)/(\bar b - \bar a)$ of the subdivision map. This suggests a practical rule-of-thumb in assessing how far Bézier curves and surfaces may be subdivided without exceeding prescribed (worst-case) bounds on the typical errors in their control points. The exponential growth of $\kappa_\infty(\mathbf M)$ with $n$ also argues forcefully against the use of high-degree forms in computer-aided geometric design applications.},

    abstract = {By virtue of their special algebraic structures, Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves offer unique advantages for computer-aided design and manufacturing, robotics, motion control, path planning, computer graphics, animation, and related fields. This book offers a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of the mathematical theory of PH curves, including algorithms for their construction and examples of their practical applications. Special features include an emphasis on the interplay of ideas from algebra and geometry and their historical origins, detailed algorithm descriptions, and many figures and worked examples. The book may appeal, in whole or in part, to mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers.}
