    abstract = {The linear map $\mathbf{M}$ that takes the Bernstein coefficients of a polynomial $P(t)$ on a given interval $\lbrack a, b\rbrack$ into those on any subinterval $\lbrack\bar a, \bar b\rbrack$ is specified by a stochastic matrix which depends only on the degree $n$ of $P(t)$ and the size and location of $\lbrack\bar a, \bar b\rbrack$ relative to $\lbrack a, b\rbrack$. We show that in the $\|\cdot\|_\infty$-norm, the condition number of $\mathbf{M}$ has the simple form $\kappa_\infty(\mathbf{M}) = \lbrack 2 f \max(u_{\bar m}, \nu_{\bar m})\rbrack^n$, where $u_{\bar m} = (\bar m - a)/(b - a)$ and $\nu_{\bar m}= (b - \bar m)/(b - a)$ are the barycentric coordinates of the subinterval midpoint $\bar m = \frac{1}{2} (\bar a + \bar b)$, and $f$ denotes the "zoom" factor $(b - a)/(\bar b - \bar a)$ of the subdivision map. This suggests a practical rule-of-thumb in assessing how far Bézier curves and surfaces may be subdivided without exceeding prescribed (worst-case) bounds on the typical errors in their control points. The exponential growth of $\kappa_\infty(\mathbf M)$ with $n$ also argues forcefully against the use of high-degree forms in computer-aided geometric design applications.},
